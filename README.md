# Eye-Detection-and-Alert-System-using-MATLAB
Developed a simple real-time eye detection system using MATLAB and the Computer Vision Toolbox. Integrated webcam feed to capture images and detect eye pairs using the vision.CascadeObjectDetector. Implemented conditional logic to determine if eyes are closed and trigger a speech alert using .NET speech synthesis.
